## 🔄 Weekly Review Process

**Every Monday:**
1. Review previous week's progress
2. Update task status
3. Identify blockers
4. Prioritize next week's tasks

**Every Friday:**
1. Update progress in PROJECT_PLAN.md
2. Commit documentation updates
3. Review and adjust roadmap

---

## 📊 Metrics to Track

- **Data Volume:** Flows/hour, sketches/hour
- **Query Performance:** Average query time
- **Correlation Accuracy:** Identity resolution success rate
- **Topology Coverage:** % of flows with location data
- **API Performance:** Response times, error rates

## 🚨 Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| PostgreSQL migration complexity | High | Start with small dataset, test thoroughly |
| Neo4j performance at scale | Medium | Benchmark early, optimize queries |
| NetFlow version compatibility | Medium | Test with multiple versions, handle edge cases |
| pxGrid integration complexity | Medium | Use existing libraries, follow Cisco docs |
| Timeline delays | Medium | Buffer time in estimates, prioritize MVP features |

---

## 📝 Notes

- All new features should maintain backward compatibility
- Database migrations must be reversible
- API changes require versioning
- UI changes should be incremental (don't break existing workflows)
